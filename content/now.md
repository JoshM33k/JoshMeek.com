## Life

- Currently my wife Jessie and I are expecting our first child, a girl, due in mid-November. We're doing our best not to panic.
- We've completed several infant care classes, but are a little concerned that none of them have given us the instruction manual yet.
- We live in Westfield Indiana, just north of Indianapolis.
