## Life

{{< ticks >}}
- My daughter Hattie is now 18 months old. She's funny, adventurous, loves being a helper. Playing with Hattie is the highlight of each day.
- We sold our current house and bought a new house, and will be moving in July. We're extremely excited, as the new house will give us separate offices and a yard for Hattie to play.

## Work
{{< ticks >}}
- I'm a Development Team Lead at [Orchard Software](https://www.orchardsoft.com/)
- We're currently hiring software engineers! If you have 2+ years of Java experience, please apply.
- With the pandemic, we have been working completely remote for over a year. It is going well, and seems like it will be continuing indefinitely.

## Fun

- I'm starting to dabble in the world of sim racing, having bought a racing wheel to use with my PC and Xbox.
- I now have strong opinions on children's programming. Peg + Cat, Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, and Bluey are my jams.
