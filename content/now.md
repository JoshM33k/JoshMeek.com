Currently my wife Jessie and I are expecting our first child, a girl, due in mid-November. We're doing our best not to panic.

The impending baby is keeping us very busy preparing the nursery and attending infant care classes.

I'm still a Development Team Lead at Orchard Software.

We live in Westfield Indiana, just north of Indianapolis.
