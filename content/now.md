## Life

- Currently my wife Jessie and I are expecting our first child, a girl, due in mid-November. We're doing our best not to panic.
- Our impending baby girl is already keeping us very busy preparing the nursery and attending infant care classes.
- We live in Westfield Indiana, just north of Indianapolis.
