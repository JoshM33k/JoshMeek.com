Humans are inherently bad at estimating how long things will take. Seriously, just ask my wife: "I'll be there in 15 minutes" can easily become two hours if I get distracted by some new idea or project along the way.  Moreover, humans always estimate for the best-case scenario "happy path", typically failing to account for additional time should issues arise, even if those issues are incredibly likely. We're overly optimistic in our estimations.

Overcoming this natural tendency and learning how to give accurate, realistic estimations is seen as a mark of a skilled, professional developer. The excellent [Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) discusses how to properly make these estimates, and how to justify and defend them. While it is very important as a software engineer to be able to reasonably estimate how long a task will take, we can reframe the typical "how long do you think this will take?" conversation to make it more productive for the manager asking for an estimate, and less dangerous for the developer doing the estimating.

## Unspoken Parameters

Any manager asking a developer for an estimate has an idea in mind of how long they think that task should take.
