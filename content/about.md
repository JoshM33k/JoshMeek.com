I'm a development team lead at [Orchard Software](https://www.orchardsoft.com/), a dual job that lets me guide the direction of my team and our products while still taking a hands-on approach as a developer.

I got my B.A. in Computer Science from [Hanover College](https://www.hanover.edu/) and my Masters of Computer Science from [Ball State](https://www.bsu.edu/). While in grad school, I worked as a research assistant in [S<sup>2</sup>ERC](https://www.serc.net/). After grad school, I taught an introductory CS course at Ball State.

In my spare time, I'm a massive nerd. I love movies, comics, video games, Magic the Gathering, and pro wrestling. I host a pop-culture and entertainment podcast called [Pretty Dece](https://prettydeceshow.com/) that has given me an opportunity to learn audio and video editing and graphic design.
